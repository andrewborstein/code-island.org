2015 is off to a great start for Code Island, with two great meetups in January and lots of new faces. If you click over to [our Members page](/members/), you can see who's been contributing to our work. 

### Announcements

Starting in February, we're switching our [meetups](http://www.meetup.com/Rhode-Island-Code-for-America-Brigade/) to **Monday evenings** and we'll be starting at 6:30pm instead of 6. Several people have mentioned to us that they have prior commitments on Tuesdays, so we're going to see how Mondays work. 

**Code Across America** is scheduled for February 20-22, 2015. We're looking for a venue to host another large event on one of those days. Stay tuned for updates. 

### How to Add Yourself to the Members Page

Don't see yourself on the Members page? Take these steps:

1. Go to the [Code Island People page on Github](https://github.com/orgs/codeisland/people)
2. Find the listing for yourself
3. Change the next-to-right-most column from "Private" to "Public"
4. Refresh the Members page to see your beautiful self/avatar!
